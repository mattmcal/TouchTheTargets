DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a game for the Android operating system called Touch the Targets.  
Once the game starts, a single small target will appear somewhere on 
the screen.  When the player touches the target he orshe will earn a 
point, and the target will move to another location on the screen.  The 
goal of the game is to touch as many targets as possible within 30 seconds.  

INSTRUCTIONS TO CHECKOUT AND RUN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project can be found at: https://github.com/mattmcal/TouchTheTargets
To run this application, checkout the code and import it into Eclipse 
as an Android project.
This application was designed for the Nexus One virtual device with 
Android 2.2.  It will run on Android 4.3, but the emulator's performance
was slow on my computer.
Once that emulator is running, run MainActivity.java to start the application.
